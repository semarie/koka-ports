Koka - a strongly typed functional-style language with effect types
and handlers.

Note: Koka v2 is a research language that is currently under
development and not ready for production use. Nevertheless, the
language is stable and the compiler implements the full specification.

There are many new languages being designed, but only few bring
fundamentally new concepts - like Haskell with pure versus monadic
programming, or Rust with borrow checking. Koka distinguishes itself
through effect typing, effect handlers, and Perceus memory management:

- Minimal but General

The core of Koka consists of a small set of well-studied language
features, like first-class functions, a polymorphic type-and-effect
system, algebraic data types, and effect handlers. Each of these is
composable and avoid the addition of "special" extensions by being as
general as possible.

- Effect Types

Koka tracks the (side) effects of every function in its type, where
pure and effectful computations are distinguished. The precise effect
typing gives Koka rock-solid semantics backed by well-studied category
theory, which makes Koka particularly easy to reason about for both
humans and compilers.

- Effect Handlers

Effect handlers let you define advanced control abstractions, like
exceptions, async/await, or probabilistic programs, as a user library
in a typed and composable way.

- Perceus Reference Counting

Perceus is an advanced compilation method for reference counting. This
lets Koka compile directly to C code without needing a garbage
collector or runtime system! This also gives Koka excellent
performance in practice.

- Reuse Analysis

Through Perceus, Koka can do reuse analysis and optimize
functional-style programs to use in-place updates.
